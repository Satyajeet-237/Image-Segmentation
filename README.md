# Image Segmentation

Project:

Processed the images for finding the boundaries between objects within images using the Edge-detection algorithm
• Detected different regions in images based on similarity in pixels using region-based segmentation and K-means
• Implemented watershed-based segmentation to detect the continuous boundary between two regions in the image
